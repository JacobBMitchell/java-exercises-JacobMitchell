Planning
Plan before you write any code
Questions your plan should answer...
What are the requirements for the project?
What features are (supposedly) completed?
What features need to be added?
How will I review the provided code?
How will I ensure that the provided code meets the requirements for each implemented feature?
How will I document issues or bugs as I discover them?
To implement the new features, what packages, classes, and methods will I write?
What unit tests do I need to write to ensure that my code behaves as expected?
Do I have to do any research?
Are there any unknowns? What do I need to do to get clarity?
What are my primary tasks?
How long do I estimate each of those tasks will take?
Are there any dependencies between tasks? What order do I need to complete the tasks in?

Think of planning as documenting your thought process as you review and strategize about the project
Write out a list of tasks
Estimate each task
Track how long each task actually takes
Optionally use Trello to manage your project
Acceptable planning document formats
Markdown file in your project
Google Doc
Word Doc
If you want to use another document format, ask your code reviewer for approval before getting started

Misc
Set time expectations
This assessment is similar in scope to the Solar Farm assessment though some of the time spent designing and writing code will be spent reviewing, analyzing, and debugging the provided code
